In this project, we develop a robust algorithm designed to identify and flag potentially malicious websites before users can access them. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity by preventing customers from unknowingly visiting harmful sites that could compromise their systems. Our approach involves analyzing various factors such as website metadata, URL structures, and behavioral patterns to detect threats effectively. By implementing this detection mechanism, we aim to reduce the risk of phishing attacks, malware infections, and data breaches, ultimately providing a safer browsing experience for users.
